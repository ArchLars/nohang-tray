You will follow TDD discipline â€“ meaning when tasked with writing a feature, first write a test for the specific behavior that covers the full logic of the feature, then implement just enough code to make the test pass. Continue iterating until the test verifies the implementation.

Refer to `CODING_GUIDE.md` for an overview of the project structure, build, and test commands.

Update `README` and other relevant documentation after any changes.

Install `ccache` and configure its maximum size (e.g., run `ccache -M 5G`) to speed up rebuilds.
