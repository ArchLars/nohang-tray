You will follow TDD discipline - Meaning when you are tasked with writing a feature, you first write a test for that specific behavior that hits on the entire logic of the script and goal of feature to ensure the code works with everything, and then afterwards you build the feature by testing it with the test afterwards. Keep building it until the test verify it passes with the implementation.
